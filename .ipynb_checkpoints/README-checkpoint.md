# Analysis of ridesharing data

## Purpose

The main goal of this analysis is to study data related to ridesharing fares in urban, suburban and rural areas of the United States. After carefully reviewing, cleaning, sorting and analyzing the data, the obtained information will be presented visually to provide useful insight for possible business decisions.

## Results


After analyzing a database of 2,375 observations of ridesharing information, data was sorted to extract the most relevant results, thus obtaining the following line chart which represents total fares obtained in US Dollars throughout the first 4 months of 2019 for Urban, Suburban and Rural areas of the US.

## Summay

After reviewing the data, the disparity between total drivers between areas was evident:

The number of drivers in urban areas was almost 5 times greater than that in suburban areas and it was 30 times greater compared to rural areas. The reduced number of drivers in both suburban and rural areas implies fewer rides and at the simetime higher average fares, the later causing negative impact on potential demand. 

In order to increase the number of rides in suburban and rural areas, it is advised to create incentives targeted to this specific regions that would entice potential drivers thus increasing supply, driving average fares lower and attracting more potential costumers. This would ideally increase total income obtained from these areas.
